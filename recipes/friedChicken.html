    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      It took about two decades for this style of Korean fried chicken to make
      its way into the American foodie scene. The chicken is deep fried twice to
      make the exterior extra crispy and to lock moisture in. The gochujang
      sauce is a hot, honey, spicy mix...and well, it's just fabulous. You'll
      have the family completely raving!
